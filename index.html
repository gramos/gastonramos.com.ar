  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p> I try to get fun in everything I do, including my job.
      My work involves solving problems and to achive that I use the bit's force. In these past years I've been feeling bored, mainly due to the fact tha I didn't have enough freedom for creative in my last jobs. So if you are thinking in hiring my services (I hope that) you should know that I'm not a guy that just follow directions. I like to find the best solution using the right tool for a given problem.
